# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The Purpose of this analysis is to help our client, Louise, determine the best course of action for implementing her Kickstarter campaign. Louise wants to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund her new play, Fever. She has an estimated budget of $10,000, and wants to know if there are any specific factors that can determine whether or not a campaign will be successful or not. 

## Analysis and Challenges
In this analysis, two areas were looked at as possible reasons a Kickstarter might, or might not be successful. The first relationship that was analyzed was if the launch date of the Kickstarter campaign had any effect on the outcome, and the second was if the goal amount.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The largest challenge with this analysis was simply learning how to efficiently use excel to make pivot tables. This challenge was easily overcome with practice. The task of matching the data with that of the example was also a challenge. In the outcomes based on goals part of the analysis, I Intuitively wanted to find the percentage successful/failed plays out of the total number of Kickstarter campaigns, not out of the only plays sample. The last challenge was the tediousness of altering the countifs function for each of the separate goal ranges.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
