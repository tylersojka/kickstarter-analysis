# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The Purpose of this analysis is to help our client, Louise, determine the best course of action for implementing her Kickstarter campaign. Louise wants to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund her new play, Fever. She has an estimated budget of $10,000, and wants to know if there are any specific factors that can determine whether or not a campaign will be successful or not. 

## Analysis and Challenges
In this analysis, two areas were looked at as possible reasons a Kickstarter might, or might not be successful. The first relationship that was analyzed was if the launch date of the Kickstarter campaign had any effect on the outcome, and the second was if the goal amount.
